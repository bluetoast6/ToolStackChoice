       WHAT THIS IS
       This block tells search engines and AI models what this page
       is about in a machine-readable format (JSON-LD / Schema.org).

       HOW TO USE
       • Replace every value in [SQUARE BRACKETS] with real data.
       • This template uses FAQPage schema (ideal for comparison pages).
       • Optionally add a Product or Review node for each tool compared.
       • Keep the FAQ count here in sync with the FAQ section below.
       • Validate at: https://validator.schema.org/

       AISO NOTE
       AI-powered search (SGE / Perplexity / Bing Copilot) reads
       JSON-LD to extract facts, ratings, and entity relationships.
       Keep values accurate, concise, and consistent with the visible
       page content — AI models cross-check both.

          <p>
            Make.com and n8n Cloud are both powerful workflow automation platforms, but they target
            slightly different users. Make.com focuses on a highly visual, no-code canvas that suits
            non-developers and small teams who want to automate fast without managing infrastructure.
            n8n Cloud offers more technical flexibility, open-source roots, and deeper customization
            that appeal to developers and teams with complex, API-heavy workflows.

          <p>
            Make.com is a cloud-based automation platform that lets users build multi-step workflows
            between apps and APIs using a visual drag-and-drop canvas. Originally launched as
            Integromat and rebranded as Make.com, it aims to make complex, branching automations
            accessible without writing code. Users connect popular SaaS tools, databases, and
            webhooks to create scenarios that run on schedules, events, or triggers and handle
            large volumes of data reliably.

          <p>
            n8n Cloud is the hosted version of n8n, an open-source workflow automation tool built
            for technical users and teams. It uses a node-based editor where each node can call
            APIs, transform data, or run JavaScript, making it highly flexible for custom
            integrations and data pipelines. With n8n Cloud, you get managed hosting, security,
            and maintenance, while still benefiting from n8n's open-source ecosystem and the
            option to self-host if you outgrow the SaaS plan.

          <p>
            While both tools automate workflows, their design choices and user focus are different.
            The most important differences include:
          </p>

          <ul class="ct-list">
            <li>
              Make.com is friendlier for non-developers; n8n Cloud assumes comfort with APIs,
              JSON, and basic programming concepts.
            </li>
            <li>
              n8n offers deeper customization via JavaScript and custom nodes; Make.com focuses
              on extensive pre-built modules and visual controls.
            </li>
            <li>
              Make.com is SaaS-only; n8n can be used as a managed cloud service or self-hosted,
              which appeals to teams needing more control.
            </li>
            <li>
              Both use usage-based pricing, but limits, included operations, and scaling behavior
              differ; teams with heavy workloads may see different cost curves.
            </li>
            <li>
              n8n's open-source core allows code access and community plugins; Make.com is
              closed-source but polished and tightly managed.

          <p>
            Make.com is a strong choice for non-technical users, solo operators, and small teams
            who want powerful automation without managing servers or writing code. Its visual
            interface, rich library of ready-made integrations, and scenario-based pricing make it
            attractive for marketing, operations, and SaaS-heavy workflows where speed of setup
            and ease of iteration matter more than low-level control.

          <p>
            n8n Cloud suits technical teams that need deeper customization, advanced data handling,
            or the option to move to self-hosting later. If your workflows involve complex API
            calls, custom business logic, or processing large data streams, n8n's node-based model
            and JavaScript extensibility provide more control. It is best for developers and power
            users who are comfortable working closer to the metal.

                <dd class="faq-answer">
                  <p>Yes; Make.com's visual canvas and pre-built modules are generally easier for non-technical users than n8n's more technical, node-based interface.</p>

                <dd class="faq-answer">
                  <p>n8n Cloud usually suits developers better because it supports JavaScript, custom nodes, and self-hosting options built on an open-source core.</p>

                <dd class="faq-answer">
                  <p>Make.com is SaaS-only, while n8n offers an open-source version you can self-host plus n8n Cloud for managed hosting.</p>

                </dt>
                <dd class="faq-answer">
                  <p>It depends on usage; Make.com can be cost-effective for SaaS automations, while n8n may be cheaper long-term if you self-host and optimize infrastructure.</p>

                <dd class="faq-answer">
                  <p>Make.com currently offers more pre-built integrations, while n8n focuses on flexible nodes and generic API connectors.</p>

                <dd class="faq-answer">
                  <p>Yes; both Make.com and n8n Cloud can call custom APIs, though n8n gives more control over request logic and error handling.</p>

                <dd class="faq-answer">
                  <p>Make.com is often faster to set up for simple automations because of its visual interface and templates.</p>

                <dd class="faq-answer">
                  <p>Both can handle branching, but n8n Cloud is often preferred when workflows require heavy logic and code-level customization.</p>

                <dd class="faq-answer">
                  <p>Yes; both platforms support webhooks, event-based triggers, and scheduled runs for automations.</p>

                <dd class="faq-answer">
                  <p>You can rebuild scenarios in n8n if you outgrow Make.com, but there is no one-click migration; expect to redesign workflows node by node.</p>
