          <h2 id="ct-what-a" class="ct-h2">What is Zapier?</h2>

          <p>
            Zapier is a no-code automation platform built around "Zaps": linear workflows made from triggers and actions. It focuses on simplicity and wide app support, making it ideal for non-technical users who live inside popular SaaS tools. When something happens in one app (a trigger), Zapier automatically performs one or more actions in other apps — no code required.

          <p>
            Make (formerly Integromat) is a visual automation platform that lets you design workflows as flow-chart-style "scenarios" on a canvas. It is aimed at users who want to see data moving between apps, build more complex branching logic, and fine-tune how their workflows behave. Make is more powerful than Zapier for complex automations, but requires more time to learn.

          <p>
            Zapier and Make share the same goal but take different approaches. Here are the five differences that matter most for choosing between them:

              <dt><strong>Interface</strong></dt>
              <dd>Zapier uses a linear step-by-step editor. Make uses a visual node-based canvas where you can see the whole automation at once and rearrange modules freely.</dd>

              <dt><strong>Pricing logic</strong></dt>
              <dd>Zapier prices around tasks — each step in a Zap counts as a task. Make prices around operations — each module run counts as one operation. A "task" in Zapier is roughly equivalent to an "operation" in Make, so volume matters for both. Make is often more cost-effective for complex multi-step workflows.</dd>
            </div>
            <div class="diff-list__item">
              <dt><strong>App coverage</strong></dt>

        <section aria-labelledby="ct-choose-a">
          <h2 id="ct-choose-a" class="ct-h2">Who should choose Zapier?</h2>

          <p>
            Zapier is the right choice if you want to get automations running quickly without reading much documentation. Its step-by-step interface, guided setup, and enormous app directory make it the fastest path from idea to working automation for most non-technical users.

              <strong>Non-technical founders and operators</strong> who want basic automations running in minutes without learning a new tool.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Marketing and ops teams</strong> automating standard business tasks: capturing leads, updating CRMs, sending notifications, and syncing data between popular apps.

              <strong>Teams with limited engineering resources</strong> who want automation to stay "self-serve" without depending on a developer.

            <li>
              <strong>Users who value a polished, guided experience</strong> more than deep customization or visual control.

          <p>
            Make is the better choice when your workflows are complex, with many steps, branches, and conditions that are hard to express in a linear list. Its visual canvas makes it easier to reason about complicated automations, and its pricing is often more efficient for high-volume or multi-step workflows.

            <li>Paid plans (from around the $19.99/month range on annual billing) that scale based on monthly task limits and advanced features like multi-step Zaps, paths, and team features.</li>

          <h3 class="ct-h3">Make pricing</h3>
          <ul class="ct-list">
            <li>Free or low-cost entry tiers with limits on operations and active scenarios.</li>
            <li>Paid plans that scale based on operations, data transfer, and number of active scenarios.</li>
            <li>Often more cost-effective for complex workflows with many steps, but you need to keep an eye on operation usage.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            A "task" in Zapier is roughly equivalent to an "operation" in Make — both count each step your automation runs, which is why volume matters for pricing. For complex multi-step workflows, Make's pricing model is typically more efficient.

              <div class="faq-item">
                <dt><h3 class="faq-question">Is Zapier easier to use than Make?</h3></dt>
                <dd class="faq-answer"><p>Yes. Zapier's step-by-step builder is one of the most beginner-friendly interfaces in automation. Make has a more powerful visual canvas but can feel overwhelming for non-technical users at first.</p></dd>
              </div>

              <div class="faq-item">
                <dt><h3 class="faq-question">Which is cheaper, Zapier or Make?</h3></dt>
                <dd class="faq-answer"><p>Make is generally more cost-effective for complex or high-volume workflows because its operation-based pricing rewards multi-step automations. Zapier's task-based pricing can climb quickly as your automation volume grows.</p></dd>
              </div>

              <div class="faq-item">
                <dt><h3 class="faq-question">Can Make do everything Zapier can?</h3></dt>
                <dd class="faq-answer"><p>Make can replicate most Zapier workflows and often goes further with branching logic and data transformation. However, Zapier has a larger native app directory, so some integrations may only be available on Zapier.</p></dd>
              </div>

              <div class="faq-item">
                <dt><h3 class="faq-question">Which has more integrations, Zapier or Make?</h3></dt>
                <dd class="faq-answer"><p>Zapier has a significantly larger native integration library — over 6,000 apps compared to Make's 1,500+. Both support custom API calls for tools not in their directories.</p></dd>
              </div>

              <div class="faq-item">
                <dt><h3 class="faq-question">Is Make better than Zapier for complex workflows?</h3></dt>
                <dd class="faq-answer"><p>Yes. Make's visual canvas and support for branching, looping, and data transformation make it better suited to complex multi-step automations than Zapier's linear builder.</p></dd>
              </div>

              <div class="faq-item">
                <dt><h3 class="faq-question">Can I use both Zapier and Make at the same time?</h3></dt>
                <dd class="faq-answer"><p>Yes. Many teams use Zapier for simple point-to-point integrations and Make for more complex automations that benefit from a visual canvas and richer logic.</p></dd>
              </div>

              <div class="faq-item">
                <dt><h3 class="faq-question">What is the difference between a Zap and a Make scenario?</h3></dt>
                <dd class="faq-answer"><p>A Zap is Zapier's term for a linear automation workflow made of a trigger and one or more actions. A scenario is Make's equivalent — a visual flow-chart-style automation that can include branches, loops, and data transformations.</p></dd>
              </div>

              <div class="faq-item">
                <dt><h3 class="faq-question">Which is better for non-technical founders?</h3></dt>
                <dd class="faq-answer"><p>Zapier is generally better for non-technical founders because its step-by-step interface requires no understanding of data flows or logic. Make is more powerful but has a steeper learning curve.</p></dd>
              </div>

              <div class="faq-item">
                <dt><h3 class="faq-question">Does Zapier or Make have a free plan?</h3></dt>
                <dd class="faq-answer"><p>Both have free tiers. Zapier's free plan covers basic single-step Zaps with limited monthly tasks. Make's free plan allows a small number of operations and active scenarios per month.</p></dd>
              </div>

              <div class="faq-item">
                <dt><h3 class="faq-question">Can I migrate from Zapier to Make?</h3></dt>
                <dd class="faq-answer"><p>There is no automatic migration tool. You would need to recreate your Zaps as Make scenarios manually, which is straightforward for simple workflows but takes more effort for complex ones.</p></dd>

          <p>
            <strong>Can you use both?</strong> Yes. Many teams start with Zapier for quick wins and later add Make for more complex automations. You might keep Zapier for simple point-to-point workflows and use Make for heavy, branching processes that benefit from a visual canvas.
